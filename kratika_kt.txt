While executing SA in xr-commit we sometimes see issues  in which “All Files are not analysed”.
A developer might change a source file which is not built for any platform or image (such as test or simulation code). In such cases static analysis cannot be done on all files in the changeset. A source file can be excluded from static analysis by making an entry to relevant exception list. Once an addition is made to this list SA will not be attempted on that file. Earlier, this list was managed centrally by SA team and addition was made on request from developers. 
To exclude "a.c" from analysis:
1. 1)Create a directory named ".sa" in "ws_root" directory if it is not already there.  
2. 2)Create a file named "permanent_exception_filelist.txt" in "<ws>/.sa" directory if it is not already there. 
3. 3)Add a new line and add "path to a.c".
Please categorize this issue under Root Cause “Others” and use #Tag as “#SAexceptionfile#error”.

If that refpoint is not released to devline , need to submit a manual PCR to release refpoint to devline.

DE wanted to know how this build is picked as green label build if image baseline build itself is failing? 
Answer: MPPB picks a GL EFR only if same is available & released within last 48 hrs . Otherwise , tool will switch to latest EFR on lineup , which looks like the case here. Unfortunately , MPPB pull logs doesn’t exist anymore to verify same. In order to override this behavior , -ws_efr option can come to rescue while submitting CCT through command line . A work space pull with GL and CCT submitted with option -ws-efr will ensure that MPPBs stick to using GL for build.
